The first two projects are based on ElasticSearch, a widely-popular open-source search engine, to provide quick and effective search on a small Wikpedia dataset.     
In the third project, build a simple spell checker that detects any potential misspelling and suggests a correction.      
In the last project, Use Mallet, an open-source text mining engine, to analyize a text corpus using LDA, a highly-effective unsupervised topic model.
